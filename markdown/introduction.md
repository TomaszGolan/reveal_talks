## What is reveal.js?

> A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML.

* GitHub page: [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
* Official: [demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)
* Examples: [list](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Example-Presentations)

## Why is it awesome?

1. You can write your presentation in markdown!
    - easy and fast
    - version control system
2. You can write equations using LaTeX syntax: $x^2 = \int\limits_0^x ydy$
3. You can use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/):

```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    return 0
}
```

## Moving around

* **PgDn / PgUp** - next / previous slide
* **Down / Up** - next / previous slide within a section
* **Right / Left** - next / previous section
* **Esc** - expo mode

## You can combine markdown with html syntax

<div class="left"><br>

* e.g. to obtain two columns
* or add an image with some options
* <font color="red">or add some colors</font>

</div>
<img src="../img/andy.gif" class="right">
